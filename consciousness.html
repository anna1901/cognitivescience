                    Consciousness is the state or quality of awareness or of being aware of an external object or
                    something
                    within oneself. It has been defined variously in terms of sentience, awareness, qualia,
                    subjectivity, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood or
                    soul,
                    the fact that there is something "that it is like" to "have" or "be" it, and the executive control
                    system of the mind. Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a
                    broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is. As Max Velmans and Susan Schneider
                    wrote in The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness: "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment
                    forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most
                    mysterious aspect of our lives.

                    Western philosophers, since the time of Descartes and Locke, have struggled to comprehend the
                    nature of
                    consciousness and identify its essential properties. Issues of concern in the philosophy of
                    consciousness include whether the concept is fundamentally coherent; whether consciousness can ever
                    be
                    explained mechanistically; whether non-human consciousness exists and if so how it can be
                    recognized;
                    how consciousness relates to language; whether consciousness can be understood in a way that does
                    not
                    require a dualistic distinction between mental and physical states or properties; and whether it
                    may
                    ever be possible for computing machines like computers or robots to be conscious, a topic studied
                    in
                    the field of artificial intelligence.

                    Thanks to developments in technology over the past few decades, consciousness has become a
                    significant
                    topic of interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, with significant contributions from
                    fields
                    such as psychology, anthropology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. The primary focus is on
                    understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in
                    consciousnessâ€”that is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness. The
                    majority of experimental studies assess consciousness in humans by asking subjects for a verbal
                    report
                    of their experiences (e.g., "tell me if you notice anything when I do this"). Issues of interest
                    include phenomena such as subliminal perception, blindsight, denial of impairment, and altered
                    states
                    of consciousness produced by alcohol and other drugs, or spiritual or meditative techniques.

                    In medicine, consciousness is assessed by observing a patient's arousal and responsiveness, and can
                    be
                    seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through
                    disorientation,
                    delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful
                    stimuli. Issues of practical concern include how the presence of consciousness can be assessed in
                    severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people, and how to treat conditions in which consciousness
                    is
                    impaired or disrupted. The degree of consciousness is measured by standardized behavior observation
                    scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale.

            <h3>Disorders of consciousness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Locked-in syndrome - The patient has awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and meaningful behavior (viz.,
                    eye-movement), but is isolated due to quadriplegia and pseudobulbar palsy.</li>
                <li>Minimally conscious state - The patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness and
                    displays some meaningful behavior.</li>
                <li>Persistent vegetative state - The patient has sleep-wake cycles, but lacks awareness and only
                    displays reflexive and non-purposeful behavior.</li>
                <li>Chronic coma - The patient lacks awareness and sleep-wake cycles and only displays reflexive
                    behavior.</li>
                <li> Brain death - The patient lacks awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and brain-mediated reflexive
                    behavior.</li>
            </ul>
