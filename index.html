                Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines
                the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition (in a broad sense). Cognitive scientists study
                intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform
                information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory,
                attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from
                fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and
                anthropology. The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from
                learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The
                fundamental concept of cognitive science is that "thinking can best be understood in terms of
                representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures."

            <p>Simply put: Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of cognition in humans, animals, and
                machines. It encompasses the traditional disciplines of psychology, computer science, neuroscience,
                linguistics and philosophy. The goal of cognitive science is to understand the principles of
                intelligence with the hope that this will lead to better comprehension of the mind and of learning and
                to develop intelligent devices. The cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s
                often referred to as the cognitive revolution.
